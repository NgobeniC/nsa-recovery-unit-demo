 NSA Recovery Unit Demo

Overview
This project simulates the NSA Recovery Unit (RU), a stand-alone, undetectable, anti-jamming tracking system for theft recovery and asset protection, as described by NSA Tracking Solutions. Charles handles interaction logic and simulation, while Clodate provides the UI.

Responsibilities
Charles : JavaScript logic (`src/js/*`), mock data (`src/data/mockData.js`), test HTML (`src/tests/test.html`).
Clodate : UI design (`src/html/index.html`, `src/css/styles.css`), including login screen, dashboard, and map integration.

DOM Element IDs for Clodate

- `login-screen`: Container for login form
- `username`: Username input field
- `password`: Password input field
- `login-btn`: Login button
- `dashboard`: Container for dashboard
- `map-container`: Container for map (static or Leaflet.js)
- `status`: Element for status messages (e.g., "Sleep Mode Active")
- `vehicle-id`: Element for vehicle/asset ID (e.g., "Car ABC123")
- `recovery-status`: Container for sector, battery, and last check-in
- `log`: Scrollable element for check-in/tracking logs
- `sleep-btn`: Button to activate Sleep Mode (hourly check-ins)
- `track-btn`: Button to activate Track Mode (minute-by-minute)
- `low-signal-btn`: Button to simulate low signal (e.g., basement)
- `reconnect-btn`: Button to simulate reconnect and upload stored coordinates
- `sector`: Select element for sector selection (Private, Rental, etc.)

 Integration Notes

- Clodate must include all listed DOM IDs in `src/html/index.html` for compatibility with Charles’s logic.
- The map (`map-container`) should support dynamic updates (e.g., Leaflet.js marker updates for GPS coordinates).
- The log (`log`) must be scrollable (e.g., `max-height: 200px; overflow-y: scroll;`).
- Buttons should have clear active/disabled states (e.g., highlight `sleep-btn` when active).
- Coordinate with Charles on map implementation (e.g., Leaflet.js or static placeholder).
- Reflect NSA RU’s user-friendly portal with a clean, intuitive design.
- Support sectors: Private, Rental, Courier, Construction, Agriculture, Transit.

 Running the Demo
1. Install a local server: `npm install -g http-server`
2. Run: `http-server`
3. Open `http://localhost:8080/src/tests/test.html` to test Charles’s logic.
4. After Clodate’s UI, open `http://localhost:8080/src/html/index.html`.

Mock Data
- Located in `src/data/mockData.js`.
- Example vehicle: `{ vehicleId: "ABC123", sector: "Private", lastLocation: { lat: 40.7128, lon: -74.0060 } }`
- Sectors: Private, Rental, Courier, Construction, Agriculture, Transit.


Testing
- Charles’s `test.html` will demonstrate all functionality: login, Sleep Mode (5-second check-ins), Track Mode (2-second updates), low-signal storage, reconnect uploads, sector changes.
- Clodate should test their UI with Charles’s logic to ensure compatibility.

Notes
- The demo simulates NSA RU’s undetectable nature through functionality.
- Battery life (24 months) is reflected in mock data (`battery: "85%"`).
- Contact Charles for map integration or DOM ID adjustments.

New Updates
1. Features:
   - Added details for enhanced login (custom credentials), real-time map (50km Johannesburg radius), log export, signal toggling, and mode-specific updates.
   - Included low-signal simulation and sector support based on the original README.

2. Setup:
   - Clarified access points for both `test.html` (Charles’s logic) and `index.html` (Clodate’s UI).
   - Updated to reflect `npm install` for dependencies.

3. DOM Element IDs:
   - Updated `map-container` to specify Leaflet.js dynamic updates.
   - Renamed `log` to align with the current `#battery-log` ID from your updates, ensuring consistency.
   - Kept all original IDs, adding notes for scrollable `log` and button states.

4. Integration Notes:
   - Emphasized the unique green/gray theme for Clodate’s styling.
   - Reinforced coordination with Charles for map and DOM compatibility.

5. Mock Data:
   - Adjusted `lastLocation` to match Johannesburg coordinates (-26.2041, 28.0473) from your updates.
   - Kept battery as a string ("85%") per original spec.
